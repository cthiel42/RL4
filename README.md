# RL4
An L4 microkernel written in Rust.

## Repository Structure
- `/src` is where the Rust code will live for the microkernel.
- `/docs` contains various documentation and progress reports related to this project.

## Current Objectives
1. Get the basic structure of the repository set up.
1. Get a simple rust project running on bare metal that can be tested against. This is the starting point for writing the microkernel.
